# DATA120 Assignment 2 – README

Welcome to your second assignment! This assignment will help you practice key programming concepts like control flow,
 string manipulation, data structures, functions, and combining everything into a menu-based ordering system.
 Each part is in **its own Python file**, and directions are **written directly inside the file**.
 PLEASE make sure to read and follow the comments in each file carefully.

If you have any additional questions, please reach out on Piazza!!!

## SUPER IMPORTANT ##
COMMENT YOUR CODE! WRITE DOCSTRINGS FOR YOUR FUNCTIONS!
COMMENTS AND DOCSTRINGS ARE MANDATORY!!!!!
There is no required amount of comments but you must have them, and they must demonstrate
some understanding of what your code is doing.
YOU WILL LOSE POINTS FOR NOT HAVING COMMENTS!
If you think your code might be confusing, WRITE A COMMENT!
If you've done something complicated, WRITE A COMMENT!
If you've made a variable with an unclear name or purpose, WRITE A COMMENT!
When in doubt, WRITE A COMMENT!

## Files Overview

You’ll be working on the following files:

- `01.py` – Control Flow
- `02.py` – String Manipulation
- `03.py` – Data Structures (for use in Problem 5)
- `04.py` – Functions
- `05.py` – Menu-Based Ordering System (combines previous concepts)

> All instructions are inside each file - read them before you start coding.
> Ask questions on Piazza or attend office hours if you have questions about what you should do!
> Start early so you have time to ask and we have time to help!

There may also be input files provided for testing - **do not modify them** if they are provided.

## How to Run Your Code

Use the terminal to navigate to the folder where your files are saved. To run a file, use the following command:

```bash
python [file_name.py]
or
python3 [file_name.py]
```

---

## What to Submit?

After you finish coding Problems 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, you’ll generate a single file that contains the output from those files.

MAKE SURE YOU EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS IN A TERMINAL THAT IS OPEN TO THE SAME FOLDER AS WHERE YOUR
PYTHON FILES ARE!

### Step 1: Generate Your Output File

First, delete any previous `output.txt` to avoid mixing in old output:

- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```bash
  rm output.txt
  ```

- **Windows (Command Prompt):**
  ```bash
  del output.txt
  ```

Then run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python3 01.py < inputs/input_01.txt > output.txt
python3 02.py < inputs/input_02.txt >> output.txt
python3 03.py < inputs/input_03.txt >> output.txt
python3 04.py < inputs/input_04.txt >> output.txt
python3 05.py < inputs/input_05.txt >> output.txt
```

> `>` should overwrite .txt files but delete `output.txt` first just to be safe!
> Use `>>` to append outputs to `output.txt` after the first line.

### Step 2: Submitting

- Check that your `output.txt` includes output for Problems 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
- Upload the following files to Gradescope:
  - `01.py`
  - `02.py`
  - `03.py`
  - `04.py`
  - `05.py`
  - `output.txt`

You're all set, good luck and happy coding!
